# Edge-MetaLearning-IoT
Meta-Learning for Edge IoT Devices
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using Meta-Learning, FastAPI backend, and Streamlit Dashboard.

Overview
This project implements Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on Edge IoT devices using a Meta-Learning approach (Prototypical Networks).
The system allows:
1. Smartphone sensor data collection (accelerometer + gyroscope)
2. Meta-learning based activity prediction
3. Real-time inference using FastAPI
4. A beautiful Streamlit dashboard for visualization & testing
   
Activities include:
Walking, Upstairs, Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying
